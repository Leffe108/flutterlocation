# Testing

If you want to set a custom LocationPlatform for testing you can use the `LocationPlatform.instance` property.
To pass verification, you need to extend with MockPlatformInterfaceMixin.
Here is an example with Mocktail

```dart
import 'package:flutter_test/flutter_test.dart';
import 'package:location/location.dart';
import 'package:location_platform_interface/location_platform_interface.dart';
import 'package:mocktail/mocktail.dart';
import 'package:plugin_platform_interface/plugin_platform_interface.dart';

class MockLocationPlatform extends Mock
    with MockPlatformInterfaceMixin
    implements LocationPlatform {}

void main() {
  testWidgets('get location ...', (tester) async {
    final mock = MockLocationPlatform();

    when(mock.getLocation).thenAnswer(
      (invocation) async =>
          LocationData.fromMap({'latitude': 42.0, 'longitude': 2.0}),
    );

    LocationPlatform.instance = mock;
  });
}
```
